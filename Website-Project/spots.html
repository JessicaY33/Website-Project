    <p>The big apple, the city that never sleeps, New York! Such a huge city with many districts and boroughs all over the place, with hidden treasures located in the most unlikely places, all harbored by many big and small communities. For so many places to see and go, I got some suggestions for the ones you should travel.</p>
    <p><span id = "warning">***Disclaimer: This advice is coming from someone who mostly just sits at home all day. So don't take any of this seriously***</span></p>

    <p>Some places you should check out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Central Park - It is a massive park to walk around and appreciate the scenery. It has a huge lake and some ponds with ducks, geese, and turtles as its residents.</li>
        <li>Coney Island - It's a nice place to relax and have some fun with the themepark and aquarium near by.</li>
        <button id = "website" onclick = "window.location.href = 'https://nyaquarium.com/';">Click Here to Check Out the New York Aquarium</button>
        <li>The American Museum of Natural History - A huge museum with a many floors, each with their own theme and rooms to explore and learn about.</li>
        <li>The Metropolitan Museum of Art - A huge art museum filled with different kinds of art from different backgrounds and ages, from pottery, oil paintings, and fashion to medival weaponry, egyptian tapestry, and Buddhist sculptures</li>
        <li>The Museum of the Moving Image - A small museum focusing around the history and behind-the-scenes of filmmaking as well as showcasing different types of arts, such as puppeteering and stop motion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some places I don't like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Subway - Although it's important for traveling around New York, I recommend you don't stay there any longer than you need to because most likely the station's interior is oudated, there's a weird odor lingering in the air, and an occastional dead rat nearby.</li>
        <li>Town Square - Even though it's a very popular place in New York, it's also a very popular place for tourist scammers who will try to fool people into giving them a lot money. Also this place has way too many advertisements being played everywhere and it makes my head hurt whenever I see them</li>
    </ul>
